Each phase builds upon the previous one, ensuring a solid foundation before adding more complex features. The plan follows these key principles:

1. **Database First**: Each feature starts with proper database schema and security setup
2. **Offline Support**: Built-in from the beginning, not added as an afterthought
3. **Security**: RLS policies and proper authentication implemented early
4. **Testing**: Integrated throughout development, not just at the end
5. **User Experience**: Focus on core functionality first, then enhance with animations and polish

### Getting Started

To begin implementation:

1. Review the current phase's tasks
2. Create necessary database migrations
3. Implement backend functionality
4. Build frontend components
5. Add tests
6. Document changes
