It's not really coding - I just see things, **say things, run things, and copy-paste** things, and it **mostly** works.

IDE providers constantly evolve the agents they use as well as the tools they are given.

Those providers determine usage of languages, frameworks, SaaS-offering, ...

Unless you use an open source prompt driven development tool like [bolt.diy](bolt.diy) or ‚Äì shameless plug ‚Äì [my very own piddie, WIP](https://github.com/mrsimpson/piddie), you are not going to understand why things happen ‚Äì or how to optimize for them.

### System prompt

- Implicitly included in each interaction
- Not always modifyable
- Should contain only very **generic instructions (that always apply)**

<MarkdownVisualizer
  file="/sample-system-prompt.md"
  height="150px"
  sourceTitle="sample-system-prompt.md"
  renderedTitle="Preview"
  sourceFontSize="0.75em"
  fontSize="0.75em"
  lineHeight="1.2"
/>


---

### Project prompt

- Implicitly included in each interaction
- Part of your software repository
- your project: **rules, conventions, structure**

<MarkdownVisualizer
  file="/sample-project-prompt.md"
  height="150px"
  sourceTitle="sample-project-prompt.md"
  renderedTitle="Preview"
  sourceFontSize="0.75em"
  fontSize="0.75em"
  lineHeight="1.2"
/>

<!--

Not sure how to best compose those files? Ask your LLM to help you: "Ask me what you need to know in order to provide a good system prompt to an LLM for a software development project"

-->

---

### User prompt

- Instructs the agents what to achieve
- Prefer exploration over imperative programming
- Address it like an experienced collegue who's from another project:
  - Start with the current sitution
  - Describe the target you want to achieve
  - Let him know what you already know (no guesses!)
 
**Avoid un-intentional priming!**

<!--

Guessing will prime the LLM. Due to the inference nature of LLMs, they will always start with your assumptions. They act like an amplifier.

-->

---

### Explore!

<PromptInteraction
  prompt="I want to develop an mobile application which can be used by multiple persons to go shopping.
Before we start developing it, I want you to help me shape the minimal requirements.
Ask me what you need to know in order to create a basic pdd."
  response="I'd be happy to help you shape the minimal requirements for your multi-user shopping mobile application. To create a basic Product Design Document (PDD), I need to understand several key aspects of your vision. Let me ask
you some essential questions:
<br/>
1. Core Purpose: What's the primary problem your shopping app is trying to solve? Is it for shared grocery lists, splitting costs, coordinating purchases, or something else?
<br/>
2. Target Users: Who will be using this app? Is it for families, roommates, friends, or another specific group?
<br/>
3. Key Features: What are the must-have features for your minimum viable product (MVP)? For example:<br/>
   ‚Ä¢ Shared shopping lists?<br/>
   ‚Ä¢ Real-time updates?<br/>
   ‚Ä¢ User roles/permissions?<br/>
   ‚Ä¢ Cost tracking/splitting?<br/>
<br/>
4. Platform Requirements: Are you targeting iOS, Android, or both? Any specific device compatibility needs?
<br/>
5. User Flow: How do you envision users interacting with the app? For example, creating lists, inviting others, marking items as purchased, etc.
<br/>
6. Data Management: What kind of data will need to be stored? Will users need accounts? How will data be shared between users?
<br/>
7. Monetization: Do you have plans for monetizing the app (free, subscription, ads, etc.)?
<br/>
8. Technical Constraints: Any specific technical requirements or limitations I should be aware of?
<br/>
9. Timeline: What's your expected timeline for development?
<br/>
10. Success Metrics: How will you measure if the app is successful?
<br/>
Once I have your responses to these questions, I can help draft a focused PDD that outlines the minimal requirements for your shopping application."

### Be explicit

<PromptInteraction
  fontSize="0.7rem"
  userLabel="A rubber-ducker"
  prompt="It is meant for groceries. Major objective is that only one person has to go shopping and while doing it can grab items that other persons he elaready knows (friends, family, community) in order to bring it along.
**Major features:**
-  multiple persons can edit the same shopping list if both are owners of the list.
- people of the same community can share their own lists with the group. then, the list becomes visible to the community. While shopping, the shopper can select shared shopping lists for items to bring along. During shopping, these items are merged into one list
- when going to the checkout desk, the application shall group the shopped items per source shopping list so that the shopper can easily pack them in separate bags.
Tracking prices and splitting totals is not in scope. It's only about quantities
In order to fulfill these capabilities, we need
- Shared shopping lists
- real time reactive updates
- basic roles and permissions (communities, list owners, shares)
- being able to share a list
CRUD interactions for the list and items are necessary. Additional actions: select bring-along-lists, go shopping, mark items purchased, checkout, end shopping (ending a shopping will move all non-purchased items to a new list).
**Let's not get into the details of the technical implementation**. Let me know if there are aspects you don't fully understand or which you'd like to elaborate more."

### Document as-if

<PromptInteraction

  We'll be implementing the app as a react native app.
  Describe it in the readme **as if it had already been built using react native, expo**. Unit testing with jest. Also describe how to set up supabase and get started locally" />

---

### Be critical and precise

 <PromptInteraction
  userLabel="Software developer"
  prompt="the part about supabase is not correct; the policies and so on will be part of the migrations. also, we don't need a supabase account, but can use the supabase cli to develop locally: https://supabase.com/docs/guides/local-development/cli/getting-started" 
  response="You're absolutely right about the Supabase setup. Let me correct the README to reflect the use of Supabase CLI for local development instead of requiring a Supabase account, and to clarify that policies will be part of migrations." />

### Prepare the next steps

  <PromptInteraction
  userLabel="Software developer"

  prompt="ok, finally describe that all backend logic which is responsible for consistency resides within supbase. simple functions as plsql database functions, complex functions as deno functions"

  <br />
    1. PL/pgSQL Database Functions for simpler operations:
      ‚Ä¢ ...
  <br />
    2. Deno Edge Functions for more complex operations:

  <br />
Would you like me to add this information to one of the documentation files we've created, such as the architecture document or README?"
